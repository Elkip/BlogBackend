# ktor-api

ktor-api is powered by [Ktor](http://ktor.io) framework. Dockerized and comes with a custom password encrypter/decrypter.

This backend has been retired in favor of a more simple pre-build backend for blogging. It was a fun project but took a lot of time to maintain SSL and Java certs, and additionally java can be very memory intensive even when the app is idle.
